# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry, as acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify the key factors that influence customer churn using a real-world telecom dataset.

The analysis involves data cleaning, feature exploration, and data visualization to uncover patterns related to customer demographics, service usage, contract types, payment methods, tenure, and charges. Multiple charts and subplots are used to clearly highlight churn behavior across different customer segments.

The insights derived from this analysis can help businesses identify high-risk customers, design better retention strategies, and also serve as a strong foundation for future predictive modeling and machine learning applications.
